# meal-planner
Basic meal planner CLI application made as a personal learning-based project.

# Usage

Can add individual meals, show all meals by category, plan meals for the whole week and
save the ingredients needed (shopping list) to a file if needed. Will also handle basic input validation and throw needed exceptions.

Uses JDBC and Postgresql for all its database related needs. Will create tables on first startup if they do not exist.
